# given data:
angular_speed = 10  # angular speed in rad/s

# radii for different points:
radius_a = 0.5  # a) radius in meter
radius_b = 1  # a) radius in meter
radius_c = 2  # a) radius in meter

# REQ:
# velocity = ?

# SOLUTION:
velocity_1 = radius_a * angular_speed
velocity_2 = radius_b * angular_speed
velocity_3 = radius_c * angular_speed

# printing the results:
print("The velocity at 0.5m from centre is: ", velocity_1, "m/s")
print("The velocity at 1m from centre is: ", velocity_2, "m/s")
print("The velocity at 2m from centre is: ", velocity_3, "m/s")
